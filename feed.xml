When I applied for the Goldwater Scholarship in 2019, my university did not provide very many resources. I relied largely on the help of past winners and posts like this. I hope my personal experience with this process will be of help to future applicants.</p> <hr/> <hr/> <h2 id="what-is-the-goldwater-scholarship">What is the Goldwater Scholarship?</h2> <hr/> <h2 id="application-components">Application Components</h2> <p>When I applied in 2019-2020, the application contained the following components. I have included all of my answers below.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="career-goalsprofessional-aspirations">Career Goals/Professional Aspirations:</h4> <ol> <li>In one or two sentences, describe your career goals and professional aspirations. This statement will be used in publications if you are selected as a scholar. <blockquote> <p>Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. Conduct research in mathematical biology and teach at the university level.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li>What are your career goals and professional aspirations? Indicate which area(s) of mathematics, science or engineering you are considering pursuing in your research career and specify how your current academic program and your overall educational plans will assist you in achieving your career goals and professional aspirations. This is an expansion of the brief description of the career goals and professional aspirations you provided above (3000-character limit including spaces) <blockquote> <p>I aspire to eventually hold a professorship at a research oriented academic institution and to lead a research team in conducting cutting edge research on problems in mathematical biology and computational medicine. This aspiration is motivated by a desire to better understand complex biological systems that are not easily amenable to experimentation and to take advantage of advances in the biological sciences that are producing large amounts of data. I hope to conduct research that positions me to be a leader in combating human disease and understanding difficult biology through the use of computation and ultimately mathematical modeling and theory. In order to pursue these aspirations I am currently pursuing a degree in both Computer Science and Mathematics. I have found both these courses of study extremely useful in providing conceptual frameworks for problem-solving, and then have chosen to apply these frameworks to a subject area I find exciting: biomedical sciences. The course work has exposed me to both the theory behind mathematical modeling and the tools most effective for analyzing such models. I also exposed myself to a variety of types of research within the biomedical sciences to gain a breadth of perspective and to determine where I could see myself working. I began my undergraduate career conducting neuroscience research through a scholarship program, the Intensive Freshman Learning Experience at Indiana University. I then conducted a short project on computational cancer biology. Since then, I have worked for two years on a project investigating various protein systems in bacteria and their corresponding mathematical models. Throughout all of these experiences, I have sought to further my computational skills and mathematical reasoning to provide a strong foundation for future work. My current research project provides a glimpse into the type of research I hope to perform as a graduate student and beyond. This summer I will be participating in a REU, to further refine both my skills and my interests. My next educational step will be pursuing a Ph.D. in applied mathematics to gain a comprehensive education in creating mathematical models and to learn how to conduct original research. I will continue to seek out subject area expertise that will be key to thrive in an interdisciplinary research space and to fully understand how my work can further that of experimental and medical scientists. I hope my career takes shape in a way that allows me to collaborate across the mathematical and biological sciences and to share my enthusiasm for mathematics with students like my mentor has with me. I am excited to continue developing my research and teaching skills in the years to come.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li>Describe an activity or experience that has been important in helping shape or reinforce your desire to pursue a research career in science, mathematics or engineering. (1500-character limit including spaces) <blockquote> <p>Part of pursuing a degree in computer science involves being exposed to the glamorous life of working in Big Tech. This past summer, I had the opportunity to explore this life first-hand during my internship as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. While I was able to refine my coding skills and work closely with distinguished individuals in the field, I was left feeling unfulfilled every day I left work. I worked on a project that provided no positive societal impact and seemed to be merely writing scalable code. I immediately recognized that I could not spend a lifetime in industry. I had always enjoyed being involved in research, welcoming the constant challenges and learning opportunities it granted. However, after working on something that did not inspire or stimulate me for a whole summer, I know pursuing research is not merely a passion, but something I want to do for a career. A career in academic research would allow me to explore the problems that I find interesting and build a career in mathematics that will provide me fulfillment.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li>Goldwater Scholars will be representative of the diverse economic, ethnic and occupational backgrounds of families in the United States. Describe any social and/or economic impacts you have encountered that influenced your education - either positively or negatively - and how you have dealt with them. (1500-character limit including spaces) <blockquote> <p>I grew up in a small, suburban town in Indiana outside of Chicago that was equally influenced by the city and the surrounding rural communities. Growing up there was happy but not idyllic. I benefited from a strong sense of community and demographic privilege, but because of the dominance of blue-collar professions never once thought it could be possible to make a career out of intellectual work. Conducting research just wasn’t something that you could do. It wasn’t until I watched my oldest brother get involved in research while in college that I realized you could answer abstract questions for a living. His initial modeling has been continued by my research mentors, and I now feel that intellectual work is what will fulfill me. Another important aspect of my educational journey has been being a woman in a male-dominated field. Community is what allows us to find joy in our work and provides purpose for why we do our work. The real problem with being the only woman in your class is that if affects the social dynamics of that community. I have dealt with this by seeking out women role models like my research mentor who can help guide me as I grow into my own role in the field and as a leader. I hope one day to be that mentor for someone else.</p> </blockquote> </li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insight into the process of applying for the Goldwater Scholarship]]></summary></entry></feed>

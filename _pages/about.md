I am a second year PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by Murat Arcak. My research focuses on data-driven reachability analysis and safety for systems with uncertain dynamics. My broader interests lie in control theory, formal methods, and statistical learning. Additionally, I am interested in applications of my research on maritime vessels. 

Prior to my PhD studies, I worked on the Software Assurance Research and Applications team at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to provide formal methods to government sponsors, and I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Indiana University, Bloomington.

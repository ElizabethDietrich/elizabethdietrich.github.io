The purpose of this post is to provide insight into the process of applying for the Goldwater Scholarship, including an overview of the scholarship, components of my application, and recommendations. When I applied for the Goldwater Scholarship in 2019, my university did not provide very many resources. I relied largely on the help of past winners and posts like this. I hope my personal experience with this process will be of help to future applicants.

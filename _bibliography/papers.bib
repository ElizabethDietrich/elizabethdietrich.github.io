  abstract = 	 {Many of the popular reachability analysis methods rely on the existence of system models. When system dynamics are uncertain or unknown, data-driven techniques must be utilized instead. In this paper, we propose an approach to data-driven reachability that provides a probabilistic guarantee of correctness for these systems through nonconvex scenario optimization. We pose the problem of finding reachable sets directly from data as a chance-constrained optimization problem, and present two algorithms for estimating nonconvex reachable sets: (1) through the union of partition cells and (2) through the sum of radial basis functions. Additionally, we investigate numerical examples to demonstrate the capability and applicability of the introduced methods to provide nonconvex reachable set approximations.}

  	abstract ={Reachability analysis is an important method in providing
		      safety guarantees for systems with unknown or uncertain
		      dynamics. Due to the computational intractability of exact
		      reachability analysis for general nonlinear,
		      high-dimensional systems, recent work has focused on the
		      use of probabilistic methods for computing approximate reachable
		      sets. In this work, we advocate for the use of a general
		      purpose, practical, and sharp method for data-driven
		      reachability: the holdout method. Despite the simplicity of
		      the holdout method, we show---on several numerical examples
		      including scenario-based reach tubes---that the resulting
		      probabilistic bounds are substantially sharper and require
		      fewer samples than existing methods for data-driven
		      reachability. Furthermore, we complement our work with a
		      discussion on the necessity of probabilistic reachability
		      bounds. We argue that any method that attempts to
		      de-randomize the bounds, by converting the guarantees to
		      hold deterministically, requires (a) an exponential in
		      state-dimension amount of samples to achieve non-vacuous
		      guarantees, and (b) extra assumptions on the dynamics.}

  title={Symbolic Control for Autonomous Docking of Marine Surface Vessels}, 
  author={Elizabeth Dietrich* and Emir Cem Gezer* and Bingzhuo Zhong and Murat Arcak and Majid Zamani and Roger Skjetne and Asgeir Johan SÃ¸rensen},
  abstract={Docking marine surface vessels remains a largely manual task due to its safety-critical nature. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical symbolic control architecture for autonomous docking maneuvers of a dynamic positioning vessel, to provide formal safety guarantees. At the upper-level, we treat the vessel's desired surge, sway, and yaw velocities as control inputs and synthesize a symbolic controller in real-time. The desired velocities are then transmitted to and executed by the vessel's low-level velocity feedback control loop. Given a synthesized symbolic controller, we investigate methods to optimize the performance of the proposed control scheme for the docking task. The efficacy of this methodology is evaluated on a low-fidelity simulation model of a marine surface vessel in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles and, for the first time, through physical experiments on a scaled model vessel.},

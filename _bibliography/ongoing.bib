  	abstract ={Reachability analysis is an important method in providing
		      safety guarantees for systems with unknown or uncertain
		      dynamics. Due to the computational intractability of exact
		      reachability analysis for general nonlinear,
		      high-dimensional systems, recent work has focused on the
		      use of probabilistic methods for computing approximate reachable
		      sets. In this work, we advocate for the use of a general
		      purpose, practical, and sharp method for data-driven
		      reachability: the holdout method. Despite the simplicity of
		      the holdout method, we show---on several numerical examples
		      including scenario-based reach tubes---that the resulting
		      probabilistic bounds are substantially sharper and require
		      fewer samples than existing methods for data-driven
		      reachability. Furthermore, we complement our work with a
		      discussion on the necessity of probabilistic reachability
		      bounds. We argue that any method that attempts to
		      de-randomize the bounds, by converting the guarantees to
		      hold deterministically, requires (a) an exponential in
		      state-dimension amount of samples to achieve non-vacuous
		      guarantees, and (b) extra assumptions on the dynamics.},

  title={Symbolic Control for Autonomous Docking of Marine Surface Vessels}, 
  author={Elizabeth Dietrich* and Emir Cem Gezer* and Bingzhuo Zhong and Murat Arcak and Majid Zamani and Roger Skjetne and Asgeir Johan SÃ¸rensen},
  abstract={Docking marine surface vessels remains a largely manual task due to its safety-critical nature. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical symbolic control architecture for autonomous docking maneuvers of a dynamic positioning vessel, to provide formal safety guarantees. At the upper-level, we treat the vessel's desired surge, sway, and yaw velocities as control inputs and synthesize a symbolic controller in real-time. The desired velocities are then transmitted to and executed by the vessel's low-level velocity feedback control loop. Given a synthesized symbolic controller, we investigate methods to optimize the performance of the proposed control scheme for the docking task. The efficacy of this methodology is evaluated on a low-fidelity simulation model of a marine surface vessel in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles and, for the first time, through physical experiments on a scaled model vessel.},

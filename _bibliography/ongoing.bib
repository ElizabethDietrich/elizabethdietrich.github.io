  abstract={Docking marine surface vessels remains a largely manual task due to its safety-critical nature. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical symbolic control architecture for autonomous docking maneuvers of a dynamic positioning vessel, to provide formal safety guarantees. At the upper-level, we treat the vessel's desired surge, sway, and yaw velocities as control inputs and synthesize a symbolic controller in real-time. The desired velocities are then transmitted to and executed by the vessel's low-level velocity feedback control loop. Given a synthesized symbolic controller, we investigate methods to optimize the performance of the proposed control scheme for the docking task. The efficacy of this methodology is evaluated on a low-fidelity simulation model of a marine surface vessel in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles and, for the first time, through physical experiments on a scaled model vessel.},
